Sysmon Forwarding
	- admin. cmd: 
		- on collector: wecutil qc
		- on forwarder: wimrm quickconfig
	- add collector to “Event Log Readers” group
	- Event Viewer -> subscriptions

WinRM
winrm get winrm/config
winrm enumerate winrm/config/listener
winrm set winrm/config/client @{TrustedHosts="<sources>"}
winrm set winrm/config/client '@{TrustedHosts="athena,artemis"}'
on the collector computer to allow all of the source computers to use NTLM authentication when communicating with WinRM on the collector computer

Recommendations for the collector server would be to use 2012R2
When that created the WinRM listener, it also created a Service Principal Name for Kerberos authentication to the service. If something goes flakey with WEF, this is usually where it happens. 
Once WinRM is setup -  open up Event Viewer on the Collector and navigate to the area called “Subscriptions” 
Want the Windows Event Collector to start up automatically with the computer
In cmd: wevtutil gl security
Copy the channel access line (starting with “O:BAG:SYD:”) if it doesn’t end with “(A;;0x1;;;NS)” add it
In GPO 
Computer>Policies>Admin Templates>Windows Components>Event Forwarding>Configure target subscription manager
This will need to be populated with the address of your collector server in this format :
Server=http://fqdnofsubscriptionserver:5985/wsman/SubscriptionManager/WEC,Refresh=60
60 is the refresh interval on the end that indicates how often clients should check in to see if there are new subscriptions 
Computer>Policies>Admin Templates>Windows Components>Event Log Service>Security> Configure log access
paste the O:BAG:SYD line 
Make source computer initiated subscription
