# Tools
This directory contains various tools that could be useful during the CCDC competition. Note that each tool should have a corresponding information document, describing where the source can be located and how to use it. Also note that this directory (and this repository more generally) should *not* be used for development purposes; we should only include the bare minimum in this directory to get each tool to run. This reduces both the size and complexity of the repository, and since we generally do not need to compile during the competition, having the source is generally unnecessary.
