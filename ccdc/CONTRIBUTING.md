# Contributing
When contributing to this repository, please modify the appropriate branch rather than directly push changes to master. This helps prevent merge conflicts, as well as keep the repository better organized. Further, each directory should have a short README explaining its purpose, and each program, tool, or config file should have a short text file describing the following:

1. What it is and what it does
2. How to use it
  1. For config files, this includes what service/program they are for, and where they are located on the system
  2. For programs, this includes a short man page describing the various options/selectors and output format
3. Where the source code is located (if applicable)
